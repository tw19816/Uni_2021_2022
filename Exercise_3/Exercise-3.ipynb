    "The 1D diffusion equation is :\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial t} = k\\frac{\\partial^2 u}{\\partial x^2}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "You should discretize this equation onto $N_x$ space points, with separation $\\Delta x = h$, and into timesteps $\\Delta t = \\tau$.  In the equations below, I use subscript $i$ as a space index, and superscript $n$ for time indices.\n",
    "\n",
    "Having discretized the problem, you should use the _implicit_ finite difference equation, as discussed in lectures :\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\frac{u_i^{n+1} - u_i^n}{\\tau} = k \\frac{u_{i+1}^{n+1} - 2u_i^{n+1} + u_{i-1}^{n+1}}{h^2}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This can be written in matrix form $u^n = M u^{n+1}$ using :\n",

    "In the problems below, you are asked to solve the diffusion equation in the context of the heat equation. Here, $k$ is the thermal diffusivity, given by $k = \\frac{\\lambda}{\\rho C}$, where $\\lambda$ is the thermal conductivity, $\\rho$ is the density, and $C$ is the specific heat capacity. The questions below concern an iron poker of length 50cm.  You may take the thermal conductivity of iron to be a constant 59 W/m/K, its specific heat as 450 J/kg/K, and its density as 7,900 kg/m3.  You can ignore heat loss along the length of the poker.\n"

    "The implicit finite difference equation, above, will allow us to calculate the unknown 'internal' nodes, ie. $0 < i < (N_x-1)$.  However, the boundary nodes, $i=0, N_x$, must have fixed values $d_0, d_N$.  To fix the boundaries, we take the matrix M to be of size $(N_x-2) \\times (N_x-2)$, and adding a vector term :\n",
